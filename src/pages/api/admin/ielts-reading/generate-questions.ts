4. Do NOT include explanation text like "TRUE if...", "FALSE if...", etc.
5. Extract only the numbered questions or statements that need answers

**NOTIFICATION-BASED PROCESSING RULES**:
- When you see "Notification: [QuestionType]" ‚Üí ALL questions below this belong to this type until next notification

**IMPORTANT RULES**:
- Each notification controls ALL questions until the next notification appears
- Extract ONLY numbered questions or statements (like "Q1. People had expected...", "Q2. The change that...")
- Do NOT extract instruction text (like "Notification:", "Note:", "Questions 1-7:")
