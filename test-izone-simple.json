Bài đọc The pirates of the ancient Mediterranean</h2><p>The Mediterranean Sea has been a crossroads of civilizations for thousands of years, and piracy has been a constant presence throughout its history. From the ancient Phoenicians to the modern era, pirates have operated in these waters, preying on merchant ships and coastal settlements.</p><p>In ancient times, piracy was often indistinguishable from legitimate maritime trade and warfare.

The line between merchant, warrior, and pirate was often blurred, as ships would carry both goods and weapons, and crews would switch between trading and raiding depending on circumstances.</p><p>The ancient Greeks were particularly known for their maritime activities, and piracy was a common practice among many Greek city-states. The island of Crete, for example, was a notorious base for pirates who preyed on ships traveling between Greece and Egypt. The famous Greek hero Odysseus, in Homer's epic poem The Odyssey, encounters pirates and describes their activities in detail.</p>"
